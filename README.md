Wrapper and Engine joint usage: 
1) A pair of class instance and class method is taken. 
2) These pair is wrapping in Wrapper. 
3) Wrapper instances push into Engine collection. 
4) Engine class has "execute" method to execute method from (1)
So, we just need to specify our execution by command name and parameter list to get the correct answer.
